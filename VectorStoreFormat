# Best File Format for Knowledge Uploads in OpenAI Agent Builder (Vector Stores)

When providing knowledge files to an agent through a **Vector Store**, the **best file format** depends on the type of content.  

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended: `.md` (Markdown, UTF-8)

Markdown is human-readable, well-structured for semantic chunking, and **officially supported** by OpenAI‚Äôs File Search and Vector Stores.  
It‚Äôs ideal for documents, knowledge bases, manuals, and research outputs.

### **Advantages**
- Clear hierarchy via `#` headings and bullet points.  
- Natural chunking on section breaks (H1‚ÄìH3).  
- Easy for both humans and LLMs to read and maintain.  
- Rich formatting (tables, code, links) preserved in embeddings.

### **Best Practices**
1. **Structure**
   - Use logical headings (H1, H2, H3).  
   - Keep paragraphs short (~400‚Äì800 tokens per section).  
   - Separate distinct topics into their own sections.

2. **Metadata**
   Add a short metadata block at the top of each file or section:
   ```
   Title: Exact Online API Reference
   Summary: All tables, fields, and relationships.
   Date: 2025-10-20
   Source: https://example.com
   ```

3. **Tables**
   Use Markdown tables for lists or structured fields:
   ```
   | Field | Type | Description |
   |--------|------|-------------|
   | invoice_id | string | Unique invoice identifier |
   ```

4. **Avoid Redundancy**
   Reference shared definitions instead of repeating them across sections.

## üß© When to Use `.jsonl` (JSON Lines)

Use `.jsonl` **only** if your content is highly structured ‚Äî e.g., hundreds of uniform records such as API endpoints, product descriptions, or field definitions.

Each line represents one self-contained JSON object:
```json
{"id": "001", "title": "Invoice Fields", "body": "All fields related to purchase invoices...", "source": "https://example.com", "tags": ["finance", "invoice"]}
```

### **Minimum Recommended Fields**
- `id`
- `title`
- `body`
- `source` (optional but helpful)
- `tags` (optional)

## üåç Language

- You can safely use **Dutch or English** ‚Äî OpenAI‚Äôs embedding models are multilingual.  
- Keep each vector store **consistent in one language** to ensure more coherent search and retrieval.

## üß† Summary

| Use Case | Recommended Format | Why |
|-----------|-------------------|-----|
| General knowledge, manuals, research docs | `.md` | Readable, well-structured, chunk-friendly |
| Structured datasets (records, entries) | `.jsonl` | Easy to filter and index |
| Mixed languages | Separate per language | Improves retrieval accuracy |

---

**In short:**  
Start with well-structured `.md` files (UTF-8, consistent language).  
Use `.jsonl` only when you need record-level control or filtering.
